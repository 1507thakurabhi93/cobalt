# 4. Template Testing

## 4.1 Overview

Previously, to keep things simple, our walkthroughs set you up to deploy infrastructure without creating or running tests. Using the guidance from our [Cobalt Templating From Scratch](./3_NEW_TEMPLATE.md) walkthrough, you deployed infrastructure by running a CIT you built yourself. Using the [Quickstart Guide](./2_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) you deployed infrastructure by running our [*Azure Hello World CIT*](../infra/templates/az-hello-world/README.md "AZ Hello World - Cobalt Infrastructure Template").

Simply put, you've had two experiences with the Cobalt Developer Workflow (i.e. create/choose a template ---> init ---> select workspace ---> plan ---> apply ---> destroy) that did not include testing. However, we strongly encourage testing as a part of your dev worklflow. The reason is ...

> *Have yet to create a Cobalt Infrastructure Template or CIT (/kÉªt/) of your own? Design and create your first infrastructure template with Cobalt by completing our [Cobalt Templating From Scratch](./3_NEW_TEMPLATE.md) walkthrough.*

## 4.2 Goals and Objectives

ðŸ”² Understand how testing fits into the SDLC for writing *CIT*s

ðŸ”² Avoid regressions with robust unit and integration tests

ðŸ”² Feel confident in moving forward to our next recommended section: *[Operationalizing CITs - A CICD Approach](./5_OPERATIONALIZE_TEMPLATE.md)*
