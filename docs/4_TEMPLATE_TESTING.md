# 4. Template Testing

## 4.1 Overview

As software developers, we seek out opportunities to improve and grow projects via code contributions. Code contributions, whether major or gradual, require changes that unfortunately bring with them a chance for unexpected behavior to occur. Fortunately, automated testing grants us a chance to gain more predictability and control over the changes that occur from our contributions. Without automated testing, contributions to our codebase would simply be too unpredictable to be considered scalable.

With that being said, the task of building automated tests for infrastructure can feel a bit different then the kinds of tests you are used to. For this project, let's further build on what you've learned so far by introducing the approach Cobalt has taken to infrastructure testing and how that will impact what you know about the Cobalt Developer Workflow:

## 4.4 Walkthrough - Testing a Cobalt Infrastructure Template (CIT)

If you are used to writing in Terraform, you'll realize that the Cobalt Developer Workflow is the way it is because CITs are primarily written in Terraform's HCL configuration language as are the modules that they are composed of. In order to write tests in Terraform, you'll be automating this workflow.

To make automation useful for testing, you'll have to know where in the various phases of your developer workflow allow you to make sure your tests are isolated. You'll also have to know where it is that you can start making assertions about your CIT in an automated way. The following steps provide guidance on using your knowledge of the Cobalt Developer Workflow to properly write automated tests for your CIT in Terraform.

> **NOTE:** This walkthrough only focuses on running automated tests locally. Our next walkthrough *[Operationalizing CITs - A CICD Approach](./5_OPERATIONALIZE_TEMPLATE.md)* will cover ways that these automated tests can be run on code commits and various stages.

### **Step 1:** Prepare for Test Isolation

You'll want to make sure that your tests are using actual test values before running `terraform plan`. The values you provide should be non-production values so as to not affect end-user environments. In the Cobalt Develop Workflow, the opportunities to enforce isolation first begin with setting up your local environment variables, and then running `terraform init` and `terraform workspace new <workspaceName>` from your CIT's directory. You'll be automating this workflow, so make sure you have the following values ready.

> **NOTE:** Due to the beginning of the Cobalt Developer Workflow having a hard dependency on a back-end state file, both unit testing and integration testing will need these environment variables. Therefore, we recommend making these decisions early-on.

1. Prepare your environment variables. Ensure that your .env file is using non-production values as you will be referencing these when writing your automated tests. These values are usually specific to the provider your CIT is targeting. Here are a few examples:

    | Env Variables | Test Value | Description |
    |--------|----------|-----------|
    | `storage_account_name`  | Value from "TF_VAR_remote_state_account" | This value should be the storage account dedicated to the dev environment. The value lives within your .env file |
    | `container_name`  | Value from "TF_VAR_remote_state_container" | This value will be the dedicated container that will holder multiple backend remote workspace terraform state files. The value lives within your .env file . |

2. Locate the input variables from your CIT that further help you achieve test isolation. Here are all the input variables and values we used to help further prepare the az-hello-world CIT for test isolation. - *More on Input Variables:* [Terraform Input Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html)

    > **NOTE:** The az-hello-world CIT relies on a commons.tf file that enforces uniqueness of resource names for varying reasons, therefore, the names you choose below will be further transformed based on the implementation of the commons.tf file. Some of the reasons for the name transformations include work isolation and other reasons are due to resources that require unique names like fqdns.

    | Input Var Name | Test Value | Description |
    |--------|----------|-----------|
    | `workspace` | "az-hello-world-" + guid | It's important that a random guid is attached to the workspace of your tests. Teams share cloud provider resources and accounts. The workspace name may be your only solution to working in isolation from other devs on your team. |
    |  `name`  | "az-hw-unit-tst-" + guid | A prefix name for appending unique values to resources that require a unique name. Helpful for integration tests as those kinds of tests create actual infrastructure.|
    | `resource_group_location`  | "eastus" | The geo-location of the Azure datacenter in which you want the resource group that contains your infrastructure to live. A location different then production. |

### **Step 2:** Decide on which properties of your Terraform plan are testable (Unit Tests)
