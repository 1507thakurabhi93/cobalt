# 4. Template Testing

## 4.1 Overview

Because we haven't introduced the concept of what it means to test a Cobalt Infrastructure Template, on two separate occasions we set you up to get away with deploying infrastructure without any mention of creating or running tests. You deployed infrastructure by running a CIT you built yourself with guidance from the [Cobalt Templating From Scratch](./3_NEW_TEMPLATE.md) walkthrough. You also deployed infrastructure using the [*Azure Hello World CIT*](../infra/templates/az-hello-world/README.md "AZ Hello World - Cobalt Infrastructure Template") from the [Quickstart Guide](./2_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md). Simply put, you've had two experiences with the Cobalt Developer Workflow (i.e. create/choose a template ---> init ---> select workspace ---> plan ---> apply ---> destroy) that did not include testing. Let's further build on what you know so far by surfacing the approach Cobalt has taken to infrastructure testing and how that will impact the Cobalt Developer Workflow.

## 4.2 Goals and Objectives

ðŸ”² Understand how testing fits into the SDLC for writing *CIT*s

ðŸ”² Avoid regressions with robust unit and integration tests

ðŸ”² Feel confident in moving forward to our next recommended section: *[Operationalizing CITs - CICD Templates](./5_OPERATIONALIZE_TEMPLATE.md).*
