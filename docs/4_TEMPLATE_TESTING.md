# 4. Template Testing

## 4.1 Overview

Prior to this point in the walkthrough, you deployed infrastructure by running a CIT you built yourself with guidance from the [Cobalt Templating From Scratch](./3_NEW_TEMPLATE.md) walkthrough. You also deployed infrastructure using the [*Azure Hello World CIT*](../infra/templates/az-hello-world/README.md "AZ Hello World - Cobalt Infrastructure Template") from the [Quickstart Guide](./2_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md). In other words, that's two separate experiences with the Cobalt Developer Workflow (i.e. create/choose a template ---> init ---> select workspace ---> plan ---> apply ---> destroy) and so this workflow is no longer a foreign concept.

With your new level of comfort, let's build on what you know about the Cobalt Developer Workflow and introduce the testing phases. Simply put, the Cobalt Developer Workflow described above is not considered complete without testing phases.

## 4.2 Goals and Objectives

ðŸ”² Understand how testing fits into the SDLC for writing *CIT*s

ðŸ”² Avoid regressions with robust unit and integration tests

ðŸ”² Feel confident in moving forward to our next recommended section: *[Operationalizing CITs - From A to Z.. err CICD](./5_OPERATIONALIZE_TEMPLATE.md).*
